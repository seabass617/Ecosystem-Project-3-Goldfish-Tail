# Ecosystem Project 2: Goldfish Food

Second project as I make my way through "The Nature of Code". This project adds to my goldfish project by adding an attractive force which in the case will be food.

Although it appears very similar, this is different from the previous exercise in that we have an attractor object, in this case being the food, which applies a force to the fish. 

As the size of the food increases, the attraction force becomes greater as the fish can't resist the large meal!
