# Ecosystem Project 3: Goldfish Tail

Third project as I make my way through "The Nature of Code". This project adds to my goldfish project by including oscillations in the form of a swimming tail.

The speed of the tail movement is proportional to the velocity of the fish, the faster it's going to faster it will move it's tail.

A few notes on how this could be improved
- Axis of tail oscillation could be moved to where it connects to the fish
- A coasting ability could be added (fish intelligence). The fish would be able to
gauge distance and stop moving it's tail so hard as to approaches the food. Almost as if it knows that it's momentum will carry it to the target. (Math!!)
